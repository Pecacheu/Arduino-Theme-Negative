# Arduino-Theme-Negative
This is the customized Arduino IDE skin I use.

##### I call it "Negative"

It's actually a mod on a few other skins that I put together and then edited in Photoshop.

I have also provided the default arduino theme folder (from version 1.6.3), in case you want to go back to the default and have delete yours.

## Screenshots:

Everyone loves screenshots!

## Install:
###### To install an Arduino theme, folow these steps:

1. **DOWNLOAD**<br>
Download and extract the "theme" folder.
2. **BROWSE TO ARDUINO THEME FOLDER**<br>
On Mac OS X, this is usually `Macintosh HD/Applications/Arduino.app
(Right-click and select "show package contents") /Contents/Java/Lib`.
On Windows, the path should be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib`.
3. **REPLACE THEME FOLDER**<br>
You should find a file called `theme` in your lib folder. Delete this, and replace it with the new theme folder you downloaded.

That's it. You've installed a new arduino theme!
